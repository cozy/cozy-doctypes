# Apps suggestions doctype

The `io.cozy.apps.suggestions` doctype is used to store apps that are not yet installed, but might be useful for the user.

`io.cozy.apps.suggestions` are used by [Cozy-Banks](http://github.com/cozy/cozy-banks/) to extract which connectors can be suggested to the user based on his / her banking operations and used by Cozy-Pass to extract which connectors can be suggested to the user based on his / her ciphers. 

## Attributes

The available attributes in a `io.cozy.apps.suggestions` document are :

- `slug`: {string} - The suggested app's slug
- `silenced`: {boolean} - Whether the user asked to silence the suggestion or not
- `reason`: {Object} - An object describing why the suggestion is made
- `reason.code`: {string} - A code describing the reason of the suggestion. See below for existing codes
