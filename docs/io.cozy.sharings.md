# `io.cozy.sharings`

This doctype describes a sharing, ie an action made by some user to share some
documents and files from her cozy instance to other people.

- An identifier (the same for all members of the sharing)
- A list of `members`. The first one is the owner. For each member, we have the URL of the cozy, a public name, an email, a status and some credentials to authorize the transfer of data between the owner and the recipients. The status can be:
    - `owner` for the member that has created the sharing
    - `mail-not-sent` for a member that has been added, but its invitation has not yet been sent (often, this status is used only for a few seconds)
    - `pending` for a member with an invitation sent, but who has not clicked on the link
    - `seen` for a member that has clicked on the invitation link, but has not setup the Cozy to Cozy replication for the sharing
    - `ready` for a member where the Cozy to Cozy replication has been set up
    - `revoked` for a member who is on longer in the sharing
- A list of `groups`, with for each one:
    - `id`, the identifier of the io.cozy.contacts.groups
    - `name`, the name of the group
    - `addedBy`, the index of the member that has added the group
    - `read_only`, a flag to tell if the group is restricted to read-only mode
    - `revoked`, a flag set to true when the group is revoked from the sharing
- A `description` (one sentence that will help people understand what is shared and why)
- a flag `active` that says if the sharing is currently active for at least one member
- a flag `owner`, true for the document on the cozy of the sharer, and absent on the other cozy instance
- a flag `open_sharing`:
    - `true` if any member of the sharing can add a new recipient
    - `false` if only the owner can add a new recipient
- Some technical data (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `app_slug`, `preview_path`,
  `triggers`, `credentials`)
- A flag `initial_sync` present only when the initial replication is still running
- A number of files to synchronize for the initial sync, `initial_number_of_files_to_sync` (if there is no file to sync or the initial replication has finished, the field won't be here)
- A `shortcut_id` with the identifier of the shortcut file (when the recipient doesn't want to synchronize the documents on their Cozy instance)
- A list of sharing `rules`, each rule being composed of:
    - a `title`, that will be displayed to the recipients before they accept the
    sharing
    - the `doctype`
    - a `selector` (by default, it’s the `id`) and `values` (one identifier, a
    list of identifiers, files and folders inside a folder, files that are
    referenced by the same document, documents bound to a previous sharing rule)
    - `local`: by default `false`, but it can false `true` for documents that are
    useful for the preview page but doesn’t need to be send to the recipients
    (e.g. a setting document of the application)
    - `add`: What to do when a new document matches this rule (the document is
    created, or it was a document that didn’t match the rule and is modified and
    the new version matches the rule). Can be:
        - `none`: the updates are never propagated (the default)
        - `push`: the updates made on the owner are sent to the recipients
        - `sync`: the updates on any member are propagated to the other members
    - `update`: What to do when a document matched by this rule is modified. Can be:
        - `none`: the updates are never propagated (the default)
        - `push`: the updates made on the owner are sent to the recipients
        - `sync`: the updates on any member are propagated to the other members
    - `remove`: What to do when a document no longer matches this rule (the
        document is deleted, or it was a document that matched the rule, and is
        modified and the new version doesn’t match the rule):
        - `none`: the updates are never propagated (the default)
        - `push`: the updates made on the owner are sent to the recipients
        - `sync`: the updates on any member are propagated to the other members
        - `revoke`: the sharing is revoked.

# `io.cozy.shared`

This doctype is an internal one for the stack. It is used to track what
documents are shared, and to replicate changes from one Cozy to the others.

- `_id`: its identifier is the doctype and id of the referenced objet, separated by
  a `/` (e.g. `io.cozy.contacts/c1f5dae4-0d87-11e8-b91b-1f41c005768b`)
- `_rev`: the CouchDB default revision for this document (not very meaningful,
  it’s here to avoid concurrency issues)
- `revisions`: a tree with the last known `_rev`s of the referenced object
- `infos`, a map of sharing ids → `{rule, removed, binary}`
    - `rule` says which rule from the sharing must be applied for this document
    - `removed` will be true for a deleted document, a trashed file, or if the
    document does no longer match the sharing rule
    - `binary` is a boolean flag that is true only for files (and not even
    folders) with `removed: false`

## Example

```json
{
  "_id": "io.cozy.files/becbd072f742f5444f5d7837b2f4e323",
  "_rev": "1-af3192a67f2bf69e011aa1bda39e6c72",
  "revisions": {
    "rev": "4-4135d4994981c0041e3c89a681542307"
  },
  "infos": {
    "fffe04ebbec335405161f19133a0cd5c": {
      "rule": 0,
      "binary": true
    }
  }
}
```
