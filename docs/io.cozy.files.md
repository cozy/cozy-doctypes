## `io.cozy.files`

The `io.cozy.files` doctype is used for both the files and directories.

### Folder

For a folder, its attributes are:

- `type`: {string} always `directory`
- `name`: {string} the directory name
- `path`: {string} the path to this directory, which is the path of its parent, then `/`, then its name
- `created_at`: {timestamp} the date of the creation of this directory
- `updated_at`: {timestamp} the date of the last update of this directory
- `tags`: {array of strings} a list of tags

It also has a relationship with its `parent` in the JSON-API representation, and another called `data` with the files and directory inside it.

- `created_at`: {date} the date of the creation of this directory
- `updated_at`: {date} the date of the last update of this directory
- `tags`: {array of strings} a list of tags
- `size`: {number} the size of its content, in bytes
- `executable`: {bool} true is the file has the executable bit on UNIX (`chmod +x`)

    - `x`: {float}: x coordinate in the photo where the person is
    - `y`: {float}: y coordinate in the photo where the person is


It also has a relationship with its `parent` in the JSON-API representation.

For an `image`, there are 3 links to thumbnails: `small`, `medium`, and `large`.

### References

It's possible to link a file or a folder to another document.
It's called [a reference](https://cozy.github.io/cozy-stack/references-docs-in-vfs.html).
It appears in the JSON-API representation as a `refererenced_by` relationship.
