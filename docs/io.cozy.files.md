# Cozy Files doctype

## `io.cozy.files`

The `io.cozy.files` doctype is used for both the files and directories.

### Folder

For a folder, its attributes are:

- `type`: {string} always `directory`
- `name`: {string} the directory name
- `path`: {string} the path to this directory, which is the path of its parent, then `/`, then its name
- `restore_path`: {string} the restore path of the directory, if is in the trash
- `created_at`: {timestamp} the date of the creation of this directory given by the client
- `updated_at`: {timestamp} the date of the last update of this directory given by the client
- `tags`: {array of strings} a list of tags

It also has a relationship with its `parent` in the JSON-API representation, and another called `data` with the files and directory inside it.

### Files

The attributes of a file are:

- `type`: {string} always `file`
- `name`: {string} the file name
- `trashed`: {bool} true if the file is in the trash
- `restore_path`: {string} the restore path of the file, if is in the trash
- `md5sum`: {string} the checksum of its content, computed with the MD5 algorithm
- `created_at`: {date} the date of the creation of this file given by the client
- `updated_at`: {date} the date of the last update of this file given by the client
- `tags`: {array of strings} a list of tags. It is currently used to know if a file was uploaded through the mobile photo sync, with the value `library`. 
- `size`: {number} the size of its content, in bytes
- `executable`: {bool} true is the file has the executable bit on UNIX (`chmod +x`)
- `class`: {string} a class in the list: `['image', 'document', 'audio', 'video', 'text', 'binary', 'pdf', 'files', 'code', 'slide', 'spreadsheet', 'text', 'zip', 'shortcut']`
- `mime`: {string} the full mime-type
- `metadata`: {map} an optional map of metadata ([Full metadata description](io.cozy.files_metadata.md)), with for example:
    - `width`: {number}
    - `height`: {number}
    - `datetime`: {date} : date in original image file metadata
    - `gps`: {map} : localization metadata with the following attributes
        - `lat`: {float}: latitude
        - `long`: {float}: longitude
        - `city`: {string}: nearest city (optional)
        - `zip`: {string}: postal code of the nearest city (optional)
        - `country`: {string}: name of the associated country if any (optional)
    - `persons`: {array}: the maps can have the following attributes (optional)
        - `name`: {string}: then name of the tagged person on the photo
        - `created_at`: {date}: date of creation of the tag
        - `x`: {float}: x coordinate in the photo where the person is
        - `y`: {float}: y coordinate in the photo where the person is
    - `icon`: {string} : A small SVG file to use as icon for this file (optional)
    - `carbonCopy`: {boolean} : if the document is the original document imported by the connector
    - `electronicSafe`: {boolean} : if the document is secured in a secure storage

âš  `carbonCopy` and `electronicSafe` both
[need specific permission](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/files/#post-filesuploadmetadata)
to be added to a document.

It also has a relationship with its `parent` in the JSON-API representation.

For an `image`, there are 3 links to thumbnails: `small`, `medium`, and `large`.
These thumbnail links are valid for 10 minutes. After that, links will return a 400 Bad Request response code.

### References

It's possible to link a file or a folder to another document.
It's called [a reference](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/references-docs-in-vfs/).
It appears in the JSON-API representation as a `refererenced_by` relationship.

### CozyMetadata

The `io.cozy.files` doctype has [the standard `cozyMetadata`](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-doctypes/docs/#document-metadata), but with some more fields:

- `createdOn`: {string} the instance URL on which the file has created (useful if the file is shared between several cozy instances)
- `uploadedAt`: {date} the server date/time of the last upload (when the content was changed)
- `uploadedOn`: {string} the instance URL on which the file content was changed the last time
- `uploadedBy`: {map} information on which app has made the last upload
    - `slug`: {string} the slug of the application that has made the upload
    - `version`: {string} the version number of this application
    - `oauthClient`: {map} if the upload was made by an OAuth Client, information about it (`id`, `name`, and `kind`)

### Shortcuts

Shortcuts (or hyperlinks) are a special type of files. They are served with the
`application/internet-shortcut` mime-type, they have a `.url` extension, and
respect the [URL file
format](http://www.lyberty.com/encyc/articles/tech/dot_url_format_-_an_unofficial_guide.html).

They can have `metadata`:

- `sharing.status` will be set if the link can be used to open a sharing. 2
  values are possible: `new` and `seen`, depending on whether the link
  has been opened.
- `target.cozyMetadata.instance` is set to the cozy instance when relevant
  (mostly sharing and internal links)
- `target._type` is the doctype of the destination of the link (when the link
  goes to a sharing or document inside a cozy)
- `target.mime` is the mime-type of the destination of the link (when it is a
  file)
- `target.app` is the slug of the destination app (internal links only).
- `icon` {string?} contains the svg icon.

## `io.cozy.files.versions`

The `io.cozy.files.versions` is used to track old versions of a file content,
when files versioning is enabled. The attributes of a version are:

- `size`: {number} the size of its content, in bytes
- `md5sum`: {string} the checksum of its content, computed with the MD5 algorithm
- `updated_at`: {date} the date of the last update of this file given by the client
- `tags`: {array of strings} a list of tags
- `metadata`: {map} an optional map of metadata.

It also has the same `cozyMetadata` that a file (including the `uploaded*`
fields), and a relationship to the versioned file.

  "_id": "9152d568-7e7c-11e6-a377-37cbfb190b4b/3-0e6d5b72",

        "_type": "io.cozy.files"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## `io.cozy.files.settings`

This doctype is used to store settings for files. It is currenly only used for the qualification migration service.

- lastProcessedFileDate: {string} the `cozyMetadata.updatedAt` date of the last processed file. It is used to know from where the query should be starting on an index sorted by date.

## `io.cozy.files.encryption`

This doctype is used to store encryption keys for directories.
The encryption keys are stored encrypted in the same way than bitwarden's [ciphers](https://docs.cozy.io/cozy-doctypes/com.bitwarden.ciphers.html), and are used to encrypt/decrypt files' binary inside the directory.


- `_id`: {string} refers to its directory id: `io.cozy.files/<dirID>`
- `key`: {string} the encrypted key, used to encrypt/decrypt files inside the directory.
