### Categories

There are up to four categories that can be assigned to a `io.cozy.bank.operations` document. But there is only one that a connector has to set when retrieving the transactions from a bank: `automaticCategoryId`. This property has to be one of the categories ID listed [here](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-banks/blob/master/src/ducks/categories/tree.json). If you want to see more human labels, you can check the translations of each label in [english](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-banks/blob/master/src/locales/en.json) or [french](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-banks/blob/master/src/locales/fr.json).

Other category properties are to be set by other sources: the user or Cozy Banks services.

  "vendorAccountId": 1,
  "deleted": null
}
